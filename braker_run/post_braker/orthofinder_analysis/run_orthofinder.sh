def load_module_biopython():
    """
    Analyze protein sequences in a FASTA file using Biopython and shell commands.

    This function performs the following tasks:
    1. Extracts and prints the lengths of the first few protein sequences using `awk`.
    2. Computes and prints statistics (min, max, mean, median) of sequence lengths using Biopython.
    3. Compares sequence lengths to expected values and issues warnings if they fall outside the expected range.
    4. Checks file integrity by reporting file size, number of headers, and number of sequence lines.
    5. Identifies and prints any invalid amino acid characters in the sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    - The FASTA file is assumed to be named `braker.aa` and located in the current working directory.
    - Expected minimum and maximum sequence lengths are defined as `EXPECTED_MIN_LENGTH` and `EXPECTED_MAX_LENGTH`.
    - Invalid amino acid characters are defined as any character not in the set `ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV\*`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> load_module_biopython()
    ===== Checking first few protein sequences =====
    >seq1    Length: 123
    >seq2    Length: 456

    ===== Getting length statistics differently =====

    Minimum length: 50
    Maximum length: 3000
    Average length: 500.00
    Median length: 450.00

    ===== Comparing lengths to expected values =====
    Minimum length 50 is above the expected minimum length.
    Maximum length 3000 is below the expected maximum length.

    ===== Checking file integrity =====
    File size: 1.2M
    Number of headers: 1000
    Number of sequence lines: 1000

    ===== Checking for invalid amino acid characters =====
    (No output if no invalid characters are found)
