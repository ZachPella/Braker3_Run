BRAKER3 Singularity Container Setup
This guide explains how to build and run the BRAKER3 tool using a Singularity container.

Step 1: Install Singularity
Ensure Singularity is installed on your system. If not, follow the official installation guide: Singularity Installation.

Step 2: Build the Singularity Image (.sif file)
To build the Singularity image from the Docker container teambraker/braker3:latest, run the following command:

'''bash
singularity build braker3.sif docker://teambraker/braker3:latest'''
Explanation:
singularity build: Builds a Singularity image.

braker3.sif: The name of the output Singularity image file.

docker://teambraker/braker3:latest: Specifies the Docker container to use as the source.

This command downloads the Docker container and converts it into a Singularity image file (braker3.sif).

Step 3: Run BRAKER3 Using the Singularity Container
To execute BRAKER3 using the Singularity container, use the following command:

'''bash
singularity exec braker3.sif braker.pl'''
Explanation:
singularity exec: Executes a command within the Singularity container.

braker3.sif: The Singularity image file.

braker.pl: The BRAKER3 script to run.

By default, Singularity automatically mounts the user's home directory, so your data and files are accessible inside the container.

Example Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of running BRAKER3 with input files:

'''bash
singularity exec braker3.sif braker.pl --genome=genome.fa --bam=alignment.bam --species=myspecies
Replace genome.fa, alignment.bam, and myspecies with your actual input files and species name.'''

Notes
Ensure you have the necessary input files (e.g., genome FASTA, BAM files) in your working directory or provide the correct paths.

For more details on BRAKER3 parameters, refer to the BRAKER3 documentation.
