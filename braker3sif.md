**🚀 BRAKER3 Singularity Adventure: Build and Run! 🧬**  

Hi there! This guide will help you use BRAKER3—a powerful tool for finding genes in DNA—inside a Singularity container. Think of Singularity as a portable toolbox that keeps everything organized and ready to use.  

---

### **📦 What You’ll Need**  
1. **Tools to Install**:  
   - **Singularity**: A container platform to manage your tools. Install it from the [Singularity Installation Guide](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html).  
   - **Computer**: A laptop or server with sufficient memory and processing power.  

2. **Input Files**:  
   - **Genome File** (`genome.fa`): A file containing the DNA sequence of your organism.  
   - **BAM File** (`alignment.bam`): A file with aligned RNA sequencing data.  
   - **Species Name** (`myspecies`): The name of your organism (e.g., "hookworm" or "fruit fly").  

---

### **🚀 Step-by-Step Guide**  

#### **Step 1: Install Singularity**  
**Goal**: Set up Singularity to create and manage containers.  
- Follow the official installation guide: [Singularity Installation](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html).  
- *What Happens*: Once installed, you can create and run containers for tools like BRAKER3.  

---

#### **Step 2: Build the Singularity Image for BRAKER3**  
**Goal**: Create a Singularity image containing BRAKER3.  
```bash  
singularity build braker3.sif docker://teambraker/braker3:latest  
```  
*What Happens*:  
- `singularity build`: Builds the container image.  
- `braker3.sif`: The name of the Singularity image file.  
- `docker://teambraker/braker3:latest`: Pulls the BRAKER3 Docker image from the internet.  

---

#### **Step 3: Run BRAKER3 in the Singularity Container**  
**Goal**: Use BRAKER3 to annotate your genome.  

**Basic Command**:  
```bash  
singularity exec braker3.sif braker.pl  
```  
*What Happens*:  
- `singularity exec`: Runs a command inside the Singularity container.  
- `braker3.sif`: The Singularity image containing BRAKER3.  
- `braker.pl`: The BRAKER3 script for gene prediction.  

**Example Command (With Your Files)**:  
```bash  
singularity exec braker3.sif braker.pl --genome=genome.fa --bam=alignment.bam --species=myspecies  
```  
*What Happens*:  
- BRAKER3 uses the genome file (`genome.fa`), RNA alignment data (`alignment.bam`), and species name (`myspecies`) to predict genes.

### **📂 What’s Inside the Singularity Container?**  
- **BRAKER3**: The gene prediction tool.  
- **Dependencies**: All necessary software (e.g., AUGUSTUS, GeneMark) are included.  
- **Your Files**: The genome and BAM file are accessible inside the container.  

---

### **📊 Expected Outputs**  
1. **Gene Predictions** (`braker.gtf`): A file listing all predicted genes and their locations.  
2. **Protein Sequences** (`braker.aa`): A file containing the amino acid sequences of predicted proteins.  
3. **Visualizations**: Graphs and plots showing gene relationships and annotations.  

---

### **⚠️ Troubleshooting Tips**  
- **Missing Files**: Ensure `genome.fa` and `alignment.bam` are in the correct directory.  
- **Permissions**: Verify you have write access to the output directory.  
- **Log Files**: Check `braker.log` for error messages if the run fails.
